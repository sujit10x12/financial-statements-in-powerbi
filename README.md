## üóÑÔ∏è Data Extraction ‚Äî SQL View (vwGLTrans)

To centralize and simplify the data needed for financial statements, a SQL view was created in Azure Data Studio.
This view joins multiple dimension and fact tables to provide a unified dataset for Power BI modeling.

```sql
-- =============================================
-- Author:      Sujeet Singh
-- Project:     GL Retail Corporation - BI Automation
-- Description: Consolidated view for Financial Statements
-- =============================================

CREATE VIEW vwGLTrans
AS
    -- This view contains all the information required 
    -- to create automated financial statements in Power BI.

    SELECT 
        -- FactGLTran
        gl.FactGLTranID,
        gl.JournalID,
        gl.GLTranDescription,
        gl.GLTranAmount,
        gl.GLTranDate,

        -- dimGLAcct
        acc.AlternateKey AS GLAccNum,
        acc.GLAcctName,
        acc.[Statement],
        acc.Category,
        acc.Subcategory,

        -- dimStore
        store.AlternateKey AS StoreNum,
        store.StoreName,
        store.ManagerID,
        store.PreviousManagerID,
        store.ContactTel,
        store.AddressLine1,
        store.AddressLine2,
        store.ZipCode,

        -- dimRegion
        region.AlternateKey AS RegionNum,
        region.RegionName,
        region.SalesRegionName,

        -- Metadata: Last Refresh Timestamp
        CONVERT(
            DATETIME2, 
            GETDATE() AT TIME ZONE 'UTC' AT TIME ZONE 'Central Standard Time'
        ) AS [Last Refresh Date]

    FROM dbo.FactGLTran AS gl
    INNER JOIN dbo.dimGLAcct AS acc 
        ON gl.GLAcctID = acc.GLAcctID
    INNER JOIN dbo.dimStore AS store 
        ON gl.StoreID = store.StoreID
    INNER JOIN dbo.dimRegion AS region 
        ON store.RegionID = region.RegionID;
GO
```

## üß© Data Modeling in Power BI

After extracting data from the SQL view (`vwGLTrans`) created in **Azure Data Studio**, the next step was to build a robust, relational data model using **Power Query Editor** and **DAX**.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Steps to Build the Data Model

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Connect to the Database
- Connected **Power BI** to the company database via **Azure SQL Database**.  
- Imported the SQL View `vwGLTrans` as the single source of truth for all financial reporting.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Load as a Staging Query
- In **Power Query Editor**, the SQL view was loaded as a **staging query**.  
- The staging query acts as a **raw data layer**, ensuring that transformations can be referenced rather than repeated.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create Fact and Dimension Queries
- **Fact Table:** `FactGLTran` (transactions)  
- **Dimension Tables:** `dimGLAcct`, `dimStore`, `dimRegion`  
- Each was created by referencing the staging query and filtering relevant columns.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Build Relationships
- Linked dimensions to the fact table using **primary and foreign keys**:
  - `FactGLTran[GLAcctID]` ‚Üí `dimGLAcct[GLAcctID]`
  - `FactGLTran[StoreID]` ‚Üí `dimStore[StoreID]`
  - `dimStore[RegionID]` ‚Üí `dimRegion[RegionID]`
- Ensured correct **cardinality (Many-to-One)** and **referential integrity** for accurate analysis.

## üí∞ Financial Statement ‚Äî Power BI Automation


### üß© Steps to Build the Income Statement & Balance Sheet

<img width="1584" height="396" alt="banner" src="/images/income-statement.png" />

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Custom Headers Table in Excel
- Designed a **Headers Table** to control the contents and appearance of the financial statements.
- Defined **sorting order**, **hierarchy**, and **display names** for all financial line items.
- This table serves as the foundation for building a flexible and easily maintainable report.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Import Headers Table to Power BI
- Imported the custom Headers Table into the **Power BI Data Model**.
- Used it as a **template** for dynamically organizing and formatting line items.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create DAX Measures for Income Statement Logic
Built key DAX measures to automate financial statement calculations and enable dynamic reporting.

---

## üßæIncome Statement DAX Calculation

üîπ**Sum of all transactions**
```DAX
SumAmount = SUM(FactGLTran[GLTranAmount])
```

üîπ**Income Statement transactions only**
```DAX
I/S Amount = CALCULATE(
    ABS([SumAmount]),
    DimHeaders[Statement] = "Income Statement"
)
```

üîπ**Running subtotal for each section**
```DAX
I/S Subtotal = CALCULATE(
    [I/S Amount],
    FILTER(ALL(DimHeaders), DimHeaders[Sort] < MAX(DimHeaders[Sort]))
)
```

üîπ** % of Revenue (staging)**
```DAX
Staging % of Revenue =
VAR Revenue =
    CALCULATE([I/S Amount], FILTER(ALL(DimHeaders), DimHeaders[Category] = "Revenue"))
RETURN
    DIVIDE([I/S Subtotal], Revenue, 0)
```

üîπ**Final formatted % of Revenue**
```DAX
% of Revenue = FORMAT([Staging % of Revenue], "0.00%")
```
---

üîπ**Flip sign for Waterfall Chart**
```DAX
Sign Flip SumAmount = [SumAmount] * -1
```

üîπ**Gross Margin Ratio**
```DAX
Gross Margin Ratio =
VAR GrossProfit = CALCULATE([I/S Subtotal], DimHeaders[Category] = "Gross Profit")
VAR Revenue = ABS(CALCULATE([SumAmount], DimHeaders[Category] = "Revenue"))
RETURN DIVIDE(GrossProfit, Revenue, 0)
```

üîπ**Operating Margin Ratio**
```DAX
Operating Margin Ratio =
VAR OperatingMargin = CALCULATE([I/S Subtotal], DimHeaders[Category] = "EBIT")
VAR Revenue = ABS(CALCULATE([SumAmount], DimHeaders[Category] = "Revenue"))
RETURN DIVIDE(OperatingMargin, Revenue, 0)
```

üîπ**Gross Profit %**
```DAX
Gross Profit % = CALCULATE([Staging % of Revenue], DimHeaders[Category] = "Gross Profit %")
```

üîπ**Main Income Statement measure (switch logic)**
```DAX
Income Statement =
VAR Display_Filter = NOT ISFILTERED(DimGLAccts[Subcategory])
RETURN
    SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        SELECTEDVALUE(DimHeaders[MeasureName]) = "Subtotal" && Display_Filter, [I/S Subtotal],
        SELECTEDVALUE(DimHeaders[MeasureName]) = "Per_Of_Revenue" && Display_Filter, [% of Revenue],
        [I/S Amount]
    )
```

üîπ **Testing Measures**
```DAX
Is Subtotal = SELECTEDVALUE(DimHeaders[MeasureName]) = "Subtotal"
Is Filtered = ISFILTERED(DimGLAccts[Subcategory])
Is Not Filtered = NOT ISFILTERED(DimGLAccts[Subcategory])
Is Subtotal & Is Not Filtered = [Is Subtotal] && [Is Not Filtered]
```

## üßæ Balance Sheet DAX Calculation

<img width="1584" height="396" alt="banner" src="/images/balance-sheet.png" />

### üß© Steps to Build the Balance Sheet

The Balance Sheet report in Power BI automates the calculation of assets, liabilities, and equity ‚Äî dynamically updating as transactions flow into the system. It ensures accurate reflection of retained earnings and equity relationships across periods.

üîπ **Balance Sheet Amount**
```DAX
B/S Amount =
CALCULATE(
    ABS([SumAmount]),
    DimHeaders[Statement] = "Balance Sheet"
)
```

üîπ **Cumulative Amount for each section**
```DAX
Cumulative Amount =
CALCULATE(
    ABS[B/S Amount]),
    FILTER(
        ALL(DimDate),
        DimDate[Date] <= MAX(DimDate[Date])
    )
)
```

üîπ **Balance Sheet Subtotal for each section**
```DAX
B/S Subtotal =
CALCULATE(
    [Cumulative Amount],
    ALL(DimHeaders),
    DimHeaders[Balance Sheet Section] IN VALUES(DimHeaders[Balance Sheet Section])
)
```

üîπ **Opening Retained Earnings**
```DAX
Opening Retained Earnings =
CALCULATE(
    ABS([SumAmount]),
    FactGLTran[GLAcctNum] = 4100,
    ALL(DimDate),
    ALL(DimHeaders)
)
```

üîπ **Retained Earnings**
```DAX
Retained Earnings =
[Opening Retained Earnings] +
CALCULATE(
    ABS([SumAmount]),
    FILTER(ALL(DimDate), DimDate[Date] <= MAX(DimDate[Date])),
    FILTER(ALL(DimHeaders), DimHeaders[Statement] = "Income Statement")
)
```

üîπ **Total Equity**
```DAX
Total Equity = [B/S Subtotal] + [Retained Earnings]
```

üîπ **Total Liabilities & Equity**
```DAX
Total Liabilities & Equity =
CALCULATE(
    [Cumulative Balance],
    ALL(DimHeaders),
    DimHeaders[Balance Sheet Section] = "Total Liabilities"
        || DimHeaders[Balance Sheet Section] = "Total Equity"
)
+ [Retained Earnings]
```

üîπ **Final Balance Sheet Measure**
```DAX
Balance Sheet =
VAR Display_Filtered = NOT ISFILTERED(DimGLAccts[Subcategory])
RETURN
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    SELECTEDVALUE(DimHeaders[MeasureName]) = "Section_Subtotal" && Display_Filtered, [B/S Subtotal],
    SELECTEDVALUE(DimHeaders[MeasureName]) = "Retained_Earnings" && Display_Filtered, [Retained Earnings],
    SELECTEDVALUE(DimHeaders[MeasureName]) = "Total_Equity" && Display_Filtered, [Total Equity],
    SELECTEDVALUE(DimHeaders[MeasureName]) = "Total_LE" && Display_Filtered, [Total Liabilities & Equity],
    [Cumulative Balance]
)
```

## üìà Financial Ratios ‚Äî Analytical Insights

These measures enable real-time ratio analysis directly from the Power BI dashboard, providing management with deeper insights into the company‚Äôs financial health.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Gross Margin Ratio

```DAX
Gross Margin Ratio =
VAR GrossProfit = CALCULATE([I/S Subtotal], DimHeaders[Category] = "Gross Profit")
VAR Revenue = ABS(CALCULATE([SumAmount], DimHeaders[Category] = "Revenue"))
RETURN DIVIDE(GrossProfit, Revenue, 0)
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Operating Margin Ratio

```DAX
Operating Margin Ratio =
VAR OperatingMargin = CALCULATE([I/S Subtotal], DimHeaders[Category] = "EBIT")
VAR Revenue = ABS(CALCULATE([SumAmount], DimHeaders[Category] = "Revenue"))
RETURN DIVIDE(OperatingMargin, Revenue, 0)
```

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Current Ratio

```DAX
Current Ratio =
VAR CurrentAssets = CALCULATE([Cumulative Amount], DimHeaders[Category] = "Current Assets")
VAR CurrentLiabilities = CALCULATE([Cumulative Amount], DimHeaders[Category] = "Current Liabilities")
RETURN DIVIDE(CurrentAssets, CurrentLiabilities, 0)
```

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Debt Ratio

```DAX
Debt Ratio =
VAR TotalDebt = CALCULATE([Cumulative Amount], DimGLAccts[Subcategory] = "Long-term Debt")
VAR TotalAssets = CALCULATE([B/S Subtotal], DimHeaders[Category] = "Total Assets")
RETURN DIVIDE(TotalDebt, TotalAssets, 0)
```
